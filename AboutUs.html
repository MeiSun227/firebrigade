                                        On May 25, 20 men gathered in the house of farmer Antti Partanen. The
                                        purpose ofthe meeting was to hold a founding meeting of the Kauskila, Annikkala
                                        andHyypiälä firefighters.
                                        Less than a year later, on April 2, 1923, it was decided unanimously to
                                        acquire a house for the fire brigade. The house was traded by Russian
                                        emigrants.
                                        Väinö Oikkonen was elected the first head of the fire brigade and Emil Karhu the
                                        head of the rescue department. Juho Vainikka was elected head of the fire
                                        department.

                                        The needs of the house were transported by train to the Kauskila switch,
                                        from where they were then transported to the current location of the
                                        house.
                                        The house was built with helpers, with the idea of ​​tiny dances in
                                        The inauguration of the house was considered customary in 1923. After
                                        the inauguration, the renovation of the house gradually continued as
